RSL1 Visuals-minus is a lua script for RSL1 that reduces the visual quality of Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered to hopefully allow for more users who have weak computers to play the game.

\Use from github/
To install from github you'll first obviously need to download the repository files. Then download RSL1 which can be found at (https://github.com/rsl-dev/RSL) Use the RSL documentation to read up on how to use it. Once done with that, copy the source directory of Visuals-minus to the scripts folder of RSL. Optionally you should rename the directory you copied to Visuals-minus after you've put it in the scripts folder. At this point RSL should auto load the script upon game launch and you should be good to go.
